# EX09 - Contagion Simulation

### Overview
This exercise is inspired by the [Washington Postâ€™s article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) that simulated infectiousness with 2D cells in a graphical visualization. Simulations such as this are great sandboxes to practice and learn object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, and methods.

### Learning Objectives
- Gain experience modelling concepts with object-oriented programming techniques
- Practice implementing methods and utilizing method calls
- Gain comfort modelling more complex data relationships through object graphs
